# Railway Management System  (C Project)

This is a simple console-based **Railway Reservation System** built using the **C programming language**. It allows users to book, cancel, and view tickets — simulating a basic railway reservation system.

##  Features

- Book railway tickets
- Cancel booked tickets
- View all bookings
- Store data using file handling (so data doesn't disappear when the program ends)
- Simple and easy-to-understand menu interface
